# DeviantArt CSS
DA's CSS is a trainwreck on it's own. Often you come across background elements nested inside themselves with the same goddamn background color. You disable one, and scratch your head why the fuck it ain't working, only to scour through elements to find least 2 more, that do the exact same thing.

I ain't gonna tidy up this CSS or anything. I'm just plain brute-forcing my way through. Making edits on firefox, and copying changes over to script injector to test, then here to publish.
